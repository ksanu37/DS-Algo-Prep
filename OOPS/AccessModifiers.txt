Access Modifiers in C++

Used for Data Hiding. The access specifiers or access modifiers are of three types basically.

1. PUBLIC
2. PRIVATE
3. PROTECTED


PUBLIC :- Any member with public access modifiers can be accessed using an object of that class from anywhere. 

PRIVATE :-  No object can directly access the private members of the class, only the member or the friend functions are allowed to 
            access the private members

PROTECTED:- Protected members are same as private members, the difference being that the protected members of a super class can be 
            accessed from a sub-class, while the protected members can't be accessed.
