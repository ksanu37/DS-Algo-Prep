/* Static data members and Static member functions 

These members are called class fields as well as these are common to all the objects of a class and can also be 
called using the classname operator.

Static Data Members:
		The static data members are declared inside the class but they are defined outside the class, using the scope resolution operator. 

example:

class A {
int x;
public:
static int count;     -------> Declaration
};


int A::count = 0;    -------> Definition


Static Member Functions:
		The static member functions can not access non-static members of a class, they can only access static members of a class. 
		
		As they are common to all the objects, if they acesss a non-static member, this will cause ambiguity. 


---> Static Member functions don't have this pointer
---> Static Member functions can't be overloaded, can't be virtual
----> A static member function can't be declared const, volatile or const-volatile


An inner class can access only the static members of a class.  An outer class can create objects of its inner class.
